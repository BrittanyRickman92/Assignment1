<p>I am a home grown Melbournian and have spent the majority of my life living and working in Melbourne’s inner west. After a brief 4 years living in Ballarat to gain my Bachelor of Education at ACU, I moved back to Melbourne to start my career as a primary school teacher. I have had many roles as a teacher but I am currently enjoying being a part of the school’s core leadership team as the numeracy coordinator. Outside of work, I am currently busy planning my 2023 wedding with my wonderful Kiwi fiance, Josh, and spending time with our fur baby, Penny. She is a mischievous rabbit who spends more time acting like a dog than a rabbit. I speak English and a tiny bit of Japanese, which I hope will come in handy for our honeymoon!</p>

        <h1> Interest in IT </h1>
        <p>I have always been interested in IT and have found that the use of technology has always come naturally to me. As a primary school teacher, I have seen the importance of incorporating IT into my classroom as a learning tool as it allows students to be creative and express themselves in ways that they otherwise would be unable to do. These IT skills are vital skills that these students will need to function in our ever changing society once they leave school. My real interest in IT, particularly in the field of education, began when I attended an EduTech conference in 2015. Seeing the technologies available, even back then, sparked my motivation to improve IT teaching and learning at my school.</p>

      <p>  I have spent the past 4 years advocating for STEM in primary schools and I am currently working as a STEM specialist teacher. This involves teaching curriculum around digital systems, data and information and creating digital solutions. I have experience with a range of robotics kits, including Microbit, MakeyMakey, WeDo2.0, Sphero, EV3 and Raspberry Pi. However, I have only used these kits in a basic sense to teach Prep to Year 6 students. I am also considered the unofficial IT person at our school as I can easily troubleshoot common problems. We are a google school, so I am well versed in Google Suites and I have Google Admin access to manage accounts and devices.</p>

      <p>  I chose RMIT because I have no formal experience or training in IT and was looking to upskill in a way that suited my busy lifestyle. I work full time, usually quite long hours, so it was not possible for me to attend in person lectures. The flexibility that RMIT offers allows me to learn at my own pace, when it suits me. I would like to move into a career that is more IT focused however after studying for 4 years to get my Bachelor of Education and working in the Education sector for 9 years, I was not ready to throw myself into full time study. Introduction to IT is allowing me to get a taste for what life could be if I do decide to change careers.</p>

        <p>Firstly, I would like to get an understanding of where my level of expertise is at. I am expecting that Introduction to IT will give me an idea of the areas of IT I may be interested in pursuing more and which areas I enjoy. I would also like to gain some practical skills that I can use in my current career and skills that will make me a better STEM teacher.

        <h1> Ideal Job</h1>
          <p>
            Click <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/59407849?type=standout#sol=ae93057b6563fc8318e9bf10794da192dbe7e424">here</a> for advertisement

        <p>The position at ACER is as a software engineer. It is to be a part of their software development team who work together to create a platform to deliver assessment services to education departments. The position would be as a full stack developer, so I would be working in both the back and front end of the platform to both develop new applications and improve existing applications. I am drawn to this position because it is an opportunity to work in a team with diverse expertise and I have experience as a customer so know what the customer is looking for. I also like that their workplace culture includes family-friendly, flexible work arrangements. After working in an industry that is very fast paced, flexible work arrangements would be a nice change of scene.</p>

        <p>I would need experience in web application development using PHP or NodeJs. I would also need experience in and an understanding of design patterns and backend frameworks.As well as backend, the job also requires experience in one or more frontend technologies, including React, Vue and Angular. Experience in AWS services, including lambda and API Gateway, is also required. </p>

        <p>I now have some experience coding using common GIT actions and will have some experience in coding as a team once this course is completed. I also have well developed problem solving and solution design skills that I use in my current occupation daily. I am required to communicate curriculum and teaching and learning design decisions regularly as a part of my current leadership role. Through this role, I am also responsible for keeping to project timelines, both independently and for groups of employees.</p>

        <p>One way for me to gain the experience I need to apply would be to complete a Bachelor of Software Engineering. Although it is a 4 year course (including 1 year of industry placement), I believe it would give me the breadth and depth of skills and information I would need to be successful. It covers all aspects of the software development cycle including analysis, design, coding, testing and deployment.</p>

        <h1>Personal Profile</h1>

         <h3>My Myers-Briggs personality test results</h3> <p>ENFJ (a person with extraverted, intuitive, feeling and judging personality traits)</p>
       <h3>Learning style test results (from VARK-LEARN)</h3> <p>Very Strong Kinesthetic </p>
      <h3>Big Five Personality test results</h3>

        <p>
Openness to experience- 27th percentile,
Conscientiousness (Work Ethic)- 51st percentile,
Extraversion- 75th percentile,
Agreeableness- 87th percentile,
Natural reactions- 28th percentile </p>
<p>
ENFJs love helping others and have strong ideas and values.They strive to bring others together and unite to achieve a common goal and improve the world around them. They enjoy getting involved and have strong leadership qualities as they are receptive to others’ ideas, empathetic, reliable and passionate about what they believe in. However, ENFJs can be unrealistic with what they strive to accomplish and can be overly empathetic, taking on other people’s problems as their own (NERIS Analytics Limited, 2011-2022).
</p>
<p>Kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. Hands-on approaches work best with opportunities to experience the learning first hand. I learn best by watching a demonstration and having a go myself alongside or afterwards. I definitely prefer doing things, rather than just listening or reading.</p>

<p>Coming out in the low range of openness to experience tells me that I prefer technical problem-solving. Being at the low range of natural reactions means that I am resilient and not easily upset in stressful situations. This means that I can work through problems with my team in a calm manner to come to a reasonable solution that suits all members. The test also indicated that I am in the high range of both extraversion and agreeableness. This means that I am outgoing and assertive but also compassionate and prefer working and cooperating with others (123test, 2022).</p>

<p>I believe that these positive skills will be crucial for the teamwork required throughout this course. I can clearly communicate my thoughts and ideas but I am also open to hearing the ideas of my teammates. I will be able to take control of the direction of the team if I need to, but I am also happy to let others take the lead in their areas of strength. I enjoy working with others but need to ensure that I do not take on too much, or set unrealistic expectations for myself or my team members.</p>

<h1> Project Idea </h1>
<p>I would like to create a program that helps users troubleshoot common IT issues. It would be designed for schools to be used by both teachers and students to guide them through troubleshooting their own problems that they encounter with everyday classroom technology. This would include chromebooks, ipads, projectors, google suite etc. Ideally I would like it to be an app that can be used on various devices and it needs to be easy to use.</p>
<p>As a classroom teacher myself, I know first hand the frustrations of frequent issues with IT while you are trying to teach. The majority of teachers are unable to troubleshoot independently due to lack of confidence with the technology they are using. Most teachers, and students, currently have to raise a ticket with our IT department (who only work onsite one day a week) and wait for them to fix the issue. This can often take weeks due to the demand on our IT department, even though most of the time it is a quick fix.</p>
<p>When issues arise in the classroom with IT, teachers and students would be able to use the app to find troubleshooting suggestions. The app will prompt the user with questions to help determine what the route of the issue could be. These questions would be focused around what device is the issue with, any error messages that they are receiving, if it is a hardware or a software issue and exactly what is it that they can not do. Once the app has gathered enough information, it will determine the most likely cause of the issue and inform the user. It will then provide the user with clear troubleshooting instructions for them to carry out.</p>
<p> Once the user has carried out the troubleshooting instructions, the app will then check with the user to see if the problem has been solved. If it has not been solved, it will ask a few further clarifying questions to find a solution or offer a second troubleshooting instruction. If the app cannot determine the cause of the issue and a solution is not reached, a ticket will be automatically raised with the IT department, so that they can follow up and solve the problem.</p>
<p>Users can create an account, which will store all of their previous data and logged issues. This has multiple benefits. It allows the IT department to keep track of common IT issues that are occurring as well as which classrooms log the most IT issues and therefore may need to have their systems or devices upgraded. It will also allow users to view previous troubleshooting suggestions for issues that occur frequently where they can not remember how to fix it. These accounts will be linked to their school google accounts to streamline all data.</p>
<p>The app would also have a common troubleshooting page with the most frequent IT issues and the most likely causes for these issues as well as the solutions. Information about what these common issues may be could be collected from staff prior to the app being developed or added as the app is being used and the IT department collects the data.</p>
<p>The program will be developed as a chrome extension. This will be automatically pushed out to all users and all devices for ease of access. This way, the extension will already be linked to the user’s school account using the Google Cloud Databases. A chrome extension requires a number of different files; a manifest file, the background script, HTML files, CSS files and JavaScript files. The manifest file (manifest.json) tells chrome the basics it needs to know and the extra permissions that it requires. Chrome extensions follow a specific directory structure (json, <content>.js [Javascript Files], <markup>.html [HTML file], png).</p>
<p>I need to be able to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. The HTML code will involve onclick events and functions to find the solutions to the issues. This is something that I will need to do further research into however I know it is possible. No special hardware is required for this project as it will be running on devices that are already being used. Once the extension has been built, it needs to be uploaded to chrome through developer mode.</p>
<p>If this project is successful, I would launch it at my current school to trial it. It would then ideally shorten the time taken to troubleshoot IT issues in classrooms, consequently reducing the number of tickets raised with our IT department. This could then free the IT department up to improve our current IT infrastructure or better manage our data storage solutions. It will also reduce the amount of time wasted on trying to troubleshoot IT issues without any guidance as well build teacher confidence to troubleshoot independently. Ideally, if the app is successful, it will be relied on less and less as time goes on.
